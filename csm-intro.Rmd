## Introduction

This tutorial exposes you to some basic statistical concepts used in centralized statistical monitoring (CSM). Feel free to follow along in [the paper by Beauregard et al](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/basics-clinical-trial-centralized-monitoring). 

We will also introduce some basic R functions and syntax. 

```{r Rlogo, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100px"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aosmith16/r-basics-workshop/master/images/Rlogo.png")
```

## Outline

We will cover: 

- Normal distribution   
  - Z-scores and p-values  
  - Cumulative probability  
- Chi-square distribution   
  - Degrees of freedom, n  
  - p-values   

## The Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is symmetrical around mean (or average). The tails represent spread (variance) from location (central tendency)

```{r normal-dist.png, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://github.com/mjfrigaard/bmrn-teachr/blob/main/images/normal-dist.png?raw=true")
```

In R we can create a vector of random numbers using the `rnorm()` function. The `rnorm()` function takes three arguments: 

1. `n` = how many numbers to generate  
2. `mean` = the mean for the random numbers  
3. `sd` = the standard deviation for the random numbers  

Click on the **Run code** button below to see how this works. 

```{r rnorm1, exercise = TRUE}
rand_norm10 <- rnorm(n = 10)
# print to screen
rand_norm10
```

Use the `mean()` and `sd()` functions to check the mean and standard deviation for the random numbers we stored in `rand_norm10`. 

```{r mean, exercise = TRUE}
mean()
```


```{r sd, exercise = TRUE}
sd()
```
