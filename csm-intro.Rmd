## Introduction

This tutorial exposes you to some basic statistical concepts used in centralized statistical monitoring (CSM). Feel free to follow along in [the paper by Beauregard et al](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/basics-clinical-trial-centralized-monitoring). 

```{r paper-png, echo = FALSE, out.height='80%', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjfrigaard/bmrn-teachr/main/images/paper.png?token=AB73BRWED23E7EN33BDSOZDACL3GK")
```

To help understand these topics, we're going to be using the R statistical programming language.  

```{r Rlogo, echo = FALSE, out.height = "80%", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aosmith16/r-basics-workshop/master/images/Rlogo.png")
```

You don't need to download or install any additional software to work though this tutorial (it's all your browser!).

## Outline

We will cover: 

- Normal distribution   
  - sample size (`n`)  
  - mean and standard deviation (`sd`)    
  - visualizing the normal distribution  
  - z-scores and p-values   
  - cumulative probability  

- Chi-square distribution   
  - degrees of freedom (`df`) and sample size (`n`) 
  - visualizing the chi-square distribution    
  - p-values   
  
- Detecting outliers

## The normal distribution (Intro)

The normal distribution is symmetrical around the mean (or average). The tails represent the spread (variance) from the location (central tendency).

```{r normal-dist.png, echo = FALSE, out.height = "80%", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://github.com/mjfrigaard/bmrn-teachr/blob/main/images/normal-dist.png?raw=true")
```



## Generating a normal distribution

In R we can create a vector of random numbers using the `rnorm()` function. `r` stands for *random*, and `norm` stands for *normal*.

The `rnorm()` function has three arguments: 

1. `n` = how many numbers to generate  
2. `mean` = the mean for the random numbers  
3. `sd` = the standard deviation for the random numbers  

Create the `rand_norm10` vector by setting `n` to `10`. We will leave the `mean` and `sd` blank for this exercise. 

```{r prepare-rand_norm10}
rand_norm10 <- rnorm(n = 10)
```

Enter `10` inside the `rnorm()` function and click on the **Run Code** button below to see how this works. 

```{r rand_norm10, exercise = TRUE}
rand_norm10 <- rnorm(n = )
# print to screen
rand_norm10
```

Now we will use the `mean()` and `sd()` functions to check the mean and standard deviation for the random numbers we stored in `rand_norm10`.

Place `rand_norm10` inside `mean()` and click on the **Run Code** button.

```{r mean, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-rand_norm10"}
mean()
```

Place `rand_norm10` inside `sd()` and click on the **Run Code** button.

```{r sd, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-rand_norm10"}
sd()
```

The default values for the `mean` and `sd` are `0` and `1`, respectively. How close are these randomly generated values to `0` and `1`?

*Programming tip: check the structure of `rand_norm10` with `str()` below* 

```{r str-rand_norm10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-rand_norm10"}
str()
```

`rand_norm10` is a numeric vector (`num`). Vectors are the most common data structure in R. 

This process of using a function to create an object (like `rand_norm10`), then using another function to explore it's contents is essential in R. Think of it as '**store and explore**'

```{r store-explore.png, echo = FALSE, out.height = "80%", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(
"https://github.com/mjfrigaard/bmrn-teachr/blob/main/images/store-explore.png?raw=true")
```


## Normal distribution: n, mean, and sd

Most of the time we're encountering data in tables (like spreadsheets), so we'll create a `data.frame` with two columns, each with a normal distribution. 

- `rand_var_01` column has a `mean` of `2` and the `sd` set to `1`

- `rand_var_02` column has a `mean` of `5` and the `sd` set to `10`

Click on the **Run Code** button below:

```{r Normal, exercise=TRUE}
Normal <- data.frame(rand_var_01 = rnorm(n = 100, 
                                         mean = 2, 
                                         sd = 1), 
                     rand_var_02 = rnorm(n = 100, 
                                         mean = 5, 
                                         sd = 10))
Normal
```

```{r prepare-Normal, echo=TRUE}
Normal <- data.frame(rand_var_01 = rnorm(n = 100, 
                                         mean = 2, 
                                         sd = 1), 
                     rand_var_02 = rnorm(n = 100, 
                                         mean = 5, 
                                         sd = 10))
```

As you can see, a `data.frame` in R is like a spreadsheet. The data are organized in rows and columns.

If we don't want to print all 100 numbers in `Normal` to the screen, we can use the [`glimpse()` function from `dplyr`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/glimpse.html)


Place `Normal` inside the `glimpse()` function and click on the **Run Code** button below to see how it works. 

*Programming tip: `glimpse()` is similar to str(), but prints more data to the screen.*  
```{r glimpse-Normal, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-Normal"}
# put the Normal inside the glimpse() function
glimpse(x = )
```

We want to see if the columns in `Normal` look like the figure below:

```{r normal-dist-png-2, echo = FALSE, out.height = "80%", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://github.com/mjfrigaard/bmrn-teachr/blob/main/images/normal-dist.png?raw=true")
```

We can use the `skim()` function from `skimr` to view the summary statistics for `Normal`. Place `Normal` inside the `skim(data = )` function and click on the **Run Code** button below to see how it works. 

```{r skim-Normal, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-Normal"}
# place the Normal inside the skim() function
skimr::skim(data = )
```

The [`skimr` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/) is great for "*displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their data.*" The `skimr::skim()` output gives us: 

- the `n_missing` and `complete_rate` (we only have two columns in `Normal`, but this comes in handy if we have a large dataset and want know what if any data are missing!)

- the `mean` gives us the average for the data (the 'central location')  
- the standard deviation (as `sd`), a measure of the data's disbursement (or 'spread')   
  - *The standard deviation (`sd`) describes how far a variable's values are spread out around their `mean`*   
- the lowest value for each variable, or minimum (as `p0`)    
- the first quartile (as `p25`), which is the 'middle' of the data points *below* the median (see below)    
- the median (as `p50`) or the 'middle' value for the data (half of the values are above, and half are below)    
- the third quartile (as `p75`), which is the 'middle' of the data points *above* the median   
  - *Together, the `p75` and `p25` can give us the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the third and first quartiles* 
- the highest value for each variable, or maximum (as `p100`)   
- the `hist` column (a small histogram for the `numeric` variables)  

***Is the `hist` shaped like the normal distribution figure?***

```{r normal-dist-png-3, echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://github.com/mjfrigaard/bmrn-teachr/blob/main/images/normal-dist.png?raw=true")
```

## Visualizing a normal distribution

As we've said before, the shape of a normal distribution is determined by the sample size (`n`), the average (or `mean`), and the standard deviation (`sd`). 

The shape of the curve in a normal distribution is always symmetrical, but it's not always the same shape. The shape of the distribution changes based on the `n`, `mean`, and `sd` arguments. 

We're going to generate a series of plots, each with a normal distribution, but with varying values for `n`, `mean`, and `sd`. 

To generate these plots, we'll be using `ggplot2`, a popular data visualization package from RStudio. **This is not a data visualization tutorial.** We are only going to cover what you need to know to visualize the two distributions we mentioned in the outline. 

```{r prepare-base}
base_layer <- ggplot()
```

First we build a canvas for our plots and store it as `base_layer`  

- `ggplot()` initiates the plot object 

```{r base, exercise=TRUE}
base_layer <- ggplot()
base_layer
```

Next we create limits for the `x` axis  

- `xlim(0, 10)` sets the limits on the x axis from 0 to 10 

```{r xlim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-base"}
base_layer + 
    # add limits for x axis 
    xlim(0, 10)
```

Now we can add a `geom_function()` layer:  

- we specify the distribution we want to see (`fun = dnorm`), `d` stands for *density*, and `norm` stands for *normal*  

- the `mean` and `sd` are arguments (`args`) we provide in a `list()`

```{r geom_function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-base"}
base_layer + 
    # x axis limits
    xlim(0, 10) +
    # add normal distribution layer
    geom_function(
        # dnorm is the normal distribution function
        fun = dnorm, 
        # the args are stored in a list(mean, sd)
            args = list(mean = 5, 
                        sd = 1))
```

There we have it--normal distribution! We can see the center of the distribution is directly above `5`. 

The reason the normal distribution is so useful is that if a variable is normally distributed, we know the following: 

1. The area under the curve that ranges from 1 standard deviation above the mean to 1 standard deviation below the mean contains approximately 68% of the data  

2. The area under the curve that ranges from 2 standard deviations above the mean to 2 standard deviations below the mean covers approximately 95% of the data

3. The area under the curve that ranges from 3 standard deviations above the mean to 3 standard deviations below the mean covers approximately 99.7% of the data

So, if we know the a sample's mean and standard deviation, we can these two measurements to find (or plot) the shape of the distribution (*provided the data were sampled from a normal distribution*). In fact, that's exactly what we just did!

Now we're going to see what happens when we change sample size: 

- set the x axis limits to `(-4, 4)`   
- change the `args` we supplied in the `list` to `n = 10` 

```{r change-mean, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-base"}
base_layer + 
    # set new x axis limits
    xlim( ) +
    # add normal distribution layer
    geom_function(
    # dnorm is the normal distribution function
        fun = dnorm, 
        # enter the new value below
            n = ) 
```

Notice that the line for the distribution isn't as smooth as it was when we supplied the mean and sd. This is because it's difficult to draw a smooth line connecting only 10 data points. We will use the `stat_function()` to add another layer to our plot so we can see the data points in this distribution. 

- `stat_function()` needs the `fun` set to `dnorm`, the `geom` set to `"point"`, and `n` set to `10` 

```{r stat_function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-base"}
base_layer + 
    # x axis limits
    xlim(-4, 4) +
    # geom function layer
    geom_function(fun = dnorm, n = 10) + 
    # fill in the stat function values...
    stat_function(
        # set to dnorm
        fun = , 
        # set geom to "point"
        geom = , 
        # set n to 10
        n = 
    )
```

We can see the line passes through all ten data points. *What if we increase the sample size?*

- Increase the sample size in each layer (`geom_function()` and `stat_function()`) to `100`

```{r stat_function-large-sample, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-base"}
base_layer + 
    xlim(-4, 4) +
    geom_function(
        fun = dnorm, 
        # enter the new value below
        n = ) + 
    stat_function(
        fun = dnorm, 
        geom = "point", 
        # enter the new value below
        n = 
    )
```

By increasing the sample size, we've made the distribution more 'bell-shaped' (it's hard to base predictions off of small samples).
